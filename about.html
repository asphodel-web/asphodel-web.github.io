        <h2>Asphodel Inc was founded by our great founder...</h2>
        <p> Mike Lex in year 2007 and was originally a small software company
          developing an office suite akin to today's Microsoft Office, which
          is the very reason why we had to change our business model unless we
          wanted to go out of business. </p>
        <p>
          We made courageous sacrifices to pull through (not paying the CEO
          additional bonuses for 2 whole months!). That's when we found an
          untapped market, centralised freelance work, or as it's called:
          coding agencies.
        </p>
        <p>
          We became one of the biggest players in said industry, paving the
          way with our innovations.
