      <h2>Asphodel Inc was founded by our great founder...</h2>
      <p> Mike Lex in year [Redacted] and was originally a small software company developing an office suite akin to today's Microsoft Office, which is the very reason why we had to change our business model unless we wanted to go out of business. </p>
      <p>
        We made courageous sacrifices to pull through (not paying the CEO additional bonuses for 2 whole months!). That's when we found an untapped market, centralised freelance work, or as it's called: coding agencies.
      </p>
      <p>
        We became one of the biggest players in said industry, paving the way with our innovations.
      </p>
      <p>
        We've recently celebrated our 25 year anniversary since founding! 
      </p>
      <p>
        We've partnered with some familiar names such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Elysium Developments (?), </li>
        <li>Wabbit, </li>
        <li>ZOOMe </li>
        <li>and Gugl! </li>
         
         
        
      </ul>
      <p>
        
        "Be the change you want to see."
